For this project, I made a pirate agent that was smart and could figure out how to get through a maze.  I got some starting code, which included setting up the environment and making a rough sketch.  I added the parts that helped the robot learn, such as the training loop, experience replay, and neural network changes.  Making sure the agent could practice, fail, and get better over time until it could solve the maze was my main job.

 This is related to computer science because it demonstrates how ideas can be put to use in the real world.  Computing experts use concepts like reinforcement learning and efficiency in real-life situations.  These skills can be used in robots, healthcare, and cybersecurity, all of which use systems that need to learn and make choices.

How to solve problems one step at a time is one of the most important things I've learned in this class.  I learned to test small parts instead of trying to fix everything at once.  Any project is open to that way of thought.

 It also helped me understand the moral side of computer science better.  Some of the things we have to think about when we make programs are data safety, fairness, and making sure systems are safe and useful for real people.
